        <strong>Recipe Recommender System</strong>
        <p>
            I built a simple system to help me find new recipes on Bon Appetit.  
            After scraping and cleaning recipe data from the website, I created a basic nearest-neighbors 
            model and a fancier collaborative filtering model to recommend likely dishes.

        <strong>Contrastive Predictive Coding</strong>
        <p> I used Contrastive Predictive Coding 
            to learn high-level features in Space Invaders, 
            with the idea that pre-training an encoder could reduce the burden on an RL agent.  
            This paper describes my implementation and an initial experiment in that direction.

        <p>
            Ok not a machine learning project, but after actual years of thinking about it, 
            I finally learned HTML and CSS and built a website in a matter of days to display cool things I've made.

        <strong>GRAMPS: Generating Really Awesome Poetry (Sometimes)</strong>
        <p> We built an RNN-based model to generate poetry, focusing on meter, rhyme, and metaphor.  
            The following example compares student life to bondage: <br />
        <samp style='margin-left:2em;'>  Demeter, my love, poor scholar, </samp><br>
        <samp style='margin-left:2em;'>Thou shalt ever dance for thy dollar. </samp><br>
        <samp style='margin-left:2em;'>You’re a bond like a pudding-sick pauper, </samp><br/>
            <samp style='margin-left:2em;'>While I—I am a professor! </samp><br/>

        <strong>NBAcme: Predicting NBA outcomes</strong>
        <p> For a final project, we trained models to forecast game results in professional basketball.
        We scraped historical and daily data, generated features including Elo scores, and trained with every 
        ML algorithm in the book to see which would give the best accuracy.  Our final accuracy was comparable 
        to that of FiveThirtyEight's NBA predictions. <br/>

        <strong>Magical Romance: Optimal Control curriculum</strong>
        <p> We wrote a light-hearted lab assignment for applied math majors to implement 
            what they learned in class about solving optimal control problems with the linear-quadratic regulator (LQR).<br>

        <strong>True online TD(λ): Classic RL</strong>
        <p>We implemented True Online TD(λ), an improvement on classic TD(λ) that allows more frequent value updates.  
            We test it in two prediction and two control tasks.<br/>

        <p> I built a basic facial recognition system using eigenfaces.  A very fun application of the math we learned in class.<br>

        <strong>MCMC: Learning hyperparameters</strong>
        <p>
        I did a lot of MCMC for one class, including Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampling, all from scratch.
        Here is one report describing results of learning the hyperparameters in a Bayesian network.<br>

            I implemented a Kalman filter and used it to predict where a projectile will strike as well as it's point of origin, from noisy observations.
