<p>
Welcome to my website, where I collect evidence that I've done some cool things before.  Like the evidence
of things I've done in the kitchen, not everything you'll see here is completely ready for public
scrutiny.  View at your own risk. <br><br>

If you are here to be convinced you should hire me, please proceed to the Projects page.  If you're here to see
pictures of Georgia, there's a page for that too.  In any case, be sure to stop by the Music page to watch me
play BWV 578 on the organ because I worked really hard on that.
